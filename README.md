# Project Overview

I worked on a project named **Product-Management-App**, where I utilized the **MEAN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) to develop a full-stack product management web application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing products, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete products, as well as user authentication and authorization, implemented using **JSON Web Tokens**, for secure access control, and **MongoDB** as the database.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend Development:

-   I used **Angular**, the latest version, to build a dynamic and responsive web application. Angular's component-based architecture allowed me to create reusable UI components, enhancing the maintainability of the code.
-   The application was developed using **TypeScript**, which provided static typing and improved code quality. This helped me catch errors early in the development process and made the code more understandable.
-   I implemented **HTML** and **CSS** for structuring and styling the application, ensuring a user-friendly interface.

### Backend Development:

-   For the server-side, I utilized **Node.js** as the runtime environment, allowing me to run JavaScript on the server.
-   I built **RESTful APIs** using **Express.js**, which facilitated communication between the frontend and backend, enabling data exchange and user interactions.

### Database:

-   I chose **MongoDB** as the NoSQL database to store application data. Its flexible schema allowed me to handle various data types efficiently.

### Development Tools:

-   I used **npm** for package and dependency management, which streamlined the installation and updating of libraries. My project dependencies are documented in the `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
-   The **Angular CLI** was instrumental in scaffolding the project and managing various development tasks efficiently.

### Version Control:

-   I managed the source code using **Git**, ensuring version control and collaboration. The presence of a `.gitignore` file helped me exclude unnecessary files from version control.

### Configuration and Build Management:

-   I configured project settings and build options using `angular.json`, which streamlined the development process.
-   I managed TypeScript compilation options through `tsconfig.json`, ensuring that the project adhered to best practices.

## Methodologies Employed

-   I adopted a **component-based architecture** in Angular, which promoted modularity and reusability of code.
-   I focused on **RESTful API design**, allowing for flexible and scalable communication between the frontend and backend.
-   I implemented a **responsive design** approach, ensuring that the application was accessible on various devices and screen sizes.

## Additional Notes

-   I included unit tests in my project, as indicated by the test files (e.g., `app.component.spec.ts`), which helped ensure the reliability of my code.
-   I maintained a comprehensive `README.md` file that documented the project setup, usage, and other essential information.
